- note here important points. (Madhu  started on 15th July 2025)
- arrange git-ignore to not take log files
- and all *generated* files (maybe from a temp subdirectory?)
- modify python program to write detailed log files
- station and od to take from an input csv file
- all input files to either be inside an inp subdirectory
  or from files saying inp1-sdflks.csv, inp2-asdflskdfaj.txt, etc.
- all input files being either csv or txt, but not xls, etc.
- ensure stripping of spaces
- ensure that stations that appear in stnList (of supply) *MATCHES* with
    origin/destinations
- ensure no vanish event at originating station, and some dual of this..??
- hhmmss into and from
- ensure that each service has just one unique set of stations. No duplications
- if semi-duplication (meaning an underscore, etc), then split the service into two
  with say upper and lower parts as names. (upper as the top part in the excel/csv column)
